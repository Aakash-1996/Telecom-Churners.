#  Problem Statement:
> In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition. 
>> 1. For many incumbent operators, retaining high profitable customers is the number one business goal.
>> 2. To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn.
    
# Business Goal:
> 1. Our Business goal is to build a model, which actually predicts which and all customers gonna be churned in future, so that the telecom company can more focus on those customers by providing matching or good quality services.
> 2. Need to know which and all features are widely influencing the churn rate or what are the factors making the customers to switch to another operator.
